# Graph Algorithms Application

This application provides an interactive platform to explore and analyze graph algorithms. It includes implementations of **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**, **Bellman-Ford**, and **Dijkstra's** algorithms. The app is designed with two distinct modes for flexibility and experimentation.

## Features

- **Graph Algorithms**:
  - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Finds the subset of edges forming a tree that minimizes the total weight of the graph.
  - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Calculates the shortest paths from a single source vertex, handling graphs with negative weights.
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Determines the shortest paths in a graph with non-negative weights using an efficient greedy approach.
  
- **Two Operational Modes**:
  1. **Single Use Mode**: 
     - Solve a single graph problem, focusing on step-by-step algorithm execution.
  2. **Test Mode**: 
     - Compare algorithm performance on multiple graphs to evaluate effectiveness and efficiency.

- **User Interface**:
  - Written in Polish, offering intuitive interaction for Polish-speaking users.
